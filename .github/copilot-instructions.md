This workspace contains a C++ DLL project (iflycli_dll) that exposes a C API for setting, getting, and listing iFly 737 MAX 8 commands. The DLL is intended for integration with Lua scripts via FFI. When generating code, prefer using the exported C API and ensure compatibility with both C++ and C consumers.
